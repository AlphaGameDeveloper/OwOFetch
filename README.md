# OwOFetch
[![Jenkins Build Status](https://jenkins.alphagame.dev/buildStatus/icon?job=OwOFetch)](http://jenkins.alphagame.dev/job/OwOFetch/)

A stupid, half-assed derivitive of [UwUFetch](https://github.com/ad-oliviero/uwufetch).

It's still a work in progress *(insert that one scene from Captain Underpants lol)*

## Releases
Whenever I hit a big milestone, I'll publish a GitHub release, but prebuilt binaries from Jenkins can be found at [releases.alphagame.dev/OwOFetch](https://releases.alphagame.dev/OwOFetch).

### macOS & Windows
Right... it's a work in progress.  I can't really find a good way to automate builds, but they *should* be there in major releases.  I *love* automation, and I prefer not to do stuff like that by hand.  However, I'll find a way!
